Simple-PHP-Circular-Image-Crop
==============================

I've been looking for a solution to create a smooth circular image crop, but to my surprise it didn't exist!

You can use Image Magick to create something like this, but alas installing Image Magick is a huge hassle, ergo I'm using PHP GD since it's avalaible in most PHP library.
