Simple-PHP-Circular-Image-Crop
==============================

I've been looking for a solution to create a smooth circular image crop, but to my surprise it didn't exist!

You can use Image Magick to create something like this, but alas installing Image Magick is a huge hassle, ergo I'm using PHP GD since it's avalaible in most PHP library.

Similar technique can be utilize by leveraging Canvas, and perhaps is much better since it doesn't require additional HTTP Request.
